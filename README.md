# Alexa Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview:-

The Alexa Sentiment Analysis project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer feedback about Alexa devices. By classifying reviews into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral, the model helps uncover sentiment trends and provide insights that could guide improvements to the Alexa experience.

## Technologies Used

1.Programming Language: Python

2.Libraries:
Text Processing: CountVectorizer, nltk, spaCy

Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: For binary classification of sentiments.
LinearSVC: A linear classifier based on Support Vector Machines.
XGBClassifier: Extreme Gradient Boosting for improved classification accuracy.
DecisionTreeClassifier: A decision tree classifier for sentiment prediction.
RandomForestClassifier: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
GradientBoostingClassifier: Gradient boosting model for effective predictions.

3.Preprocessing: MinMaxScaler, CountVectorizer

4.Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for charts and graphs.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
Source: Customer reviews from public datasets or scraped from e-commerce platforms like Amazon.
Dataset Size: 3150 reviews, including associated metadata (rating, review text).
2. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning:
Remove punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenization and Lemmatization:
Use spaCy or nltk to tokenize the text and lemmatize words.
Vectorization:
CountVectorizer is used to convert the text data into a numerical format, representing the frequency of each word in the review.
3. Feature Scaling
MinMaxScaler:
Used to scale the feature values to a range between 0 and 1, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the machine learning models.
4. Sentiment Labeling
Reviews are labeled based on ratings:
Rating ≥ 4 → Positive Sentiment
Rating = 3 → Neutral Sentiment
Rating ≤ 2 → Negative Sentiment
5. Model Training and Evaluation
Models Used:
Logistic Regression
LinearSVC
XGBClassifier
DecisionTreeClassifier
RandomForestClassifier
GradientBoostingClassifier
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate the models' performance.

### Future Enhancements

1.Expand the analysis to include sarcasm detection and more granular sentiment categories.

2.Add support for multilingual sentiment analysis.

3.Deploy the system to the cloud (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) for scalability.
